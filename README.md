TODO:
- add projection (Automatic Program Rewriting in Non-Ground Answer Set Programs)
- add concretion (Challenges in Answer Set Solving)
- add math simplification for the combination of sum constraints, maybe optimize constraints
- replace sum results in optimization constructs, can be added directly
- replace sum results in other rules. Sometimes the sum result is used in other rules only in comparisons >=, then I actually do not need the equality
